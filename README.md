# test-RNative-app
The app covers the following features 
1. Use React Native for building the app.
2. Use React Navigation for handling navigation between screens.
3. Use Axios for fetching data from the remote API.
4. Use Redux to manage the app's state.
5. Write clean and maintainable code that follows best practices.
6. The app should be functional and should not crash or have any errors.
#NOTE : I didn't implement REDUX in this app as I don't have much clearilty on it.
